Please ignore whole of Data saving&reading part, pretend it been done somewhere so perfect outside the project, 
here is just a quick mock data access layer
 
There are only 2 unit test files to just demo modules can be easily test.

And yes there are many things could improve, such as stop user post empty message, input validation, unsubscrib from following, but these new features is not difficult to add. When this project built assume it is in perfect ideal world so there is no error handling or other rich features etc. If you find missing feature it is not cann't do.
